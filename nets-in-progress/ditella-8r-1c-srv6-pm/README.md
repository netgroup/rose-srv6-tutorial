# 8r-1c-srv6-pm Topology

A Mininet topology with 8 routers running IS-IS routing protocol, 12 hosts, 3 datacenters and a controller connected out-band to all the routers and hosts of the network.

This topology is the same as 8r-1c-out-band, but same nodes are configured to run Performance Measurement experiments.

router localhost

    r1 fcff:1::1
    r2 fcff:2::1
    r3 fcff:3::1
    r4 fcff:4::1
    r5 fcff:5::1
    r6 fcff:6::1
    r7 fcff:7::1
    r8 fcff:8::1

( The addressing plan is explained in https://docs.google.com/document/d/15giV53fH_eDuWadOxzjPVzlr-a7Rn65MpCbz9QKs7JI/edit )

Note that datacenters are special hosts, which have a public address.


The file etc-hosts in the topology folder maps each IP address to its hostname.

For example,
fcff:1::1       r1
fd00:0:11::2    h11
fcff:2:1::2     hdc1
fcfd:0:0:fd::1	controller.m		# .m suffix is used for the management addresses
...

When you start the topology, the entries defined in this file are loaded and added to the system /etc/hosts file.

This allows you to ping the nodes using their hostnames instead of the IP addresses:
h11# ping6 h83
h83# ping6 h11

The entries are automatically removed from the /etc/hosts file when the emulation is stopped.


------Tunnel examples -------------
1) Create a bidirectional tunnel between h11 and h83, passing through router r4

1.1) set tunnel from r1 to r8 for fd00:0:83::/64

   on r1: ip -6 route add fd00:0:83::/64 encap seg6 mode encap segs fcff:4::1,fcff:8::1 dev r1-h11

   on r8: no explicit decap instruction is needed because net.ipv6.conf.*.seg6_enabled=1 

1.2) set tunnel from r8 to r1 for fd00:0:11::/64

   on r8: ip -6 route add fd00:0:11::/64 encap seg6 mode encap segs fcff:4::1,fcff:1::1 dev r8-h83

   on r1: no explicit decap instruction is needed because net.ipv6.conf.*.seg6_enabled=1 

after the tunnel is setup, you can ping from h11 to h83 and viceversa
h11# ping6 fd00:0:83::2
h83# ping6 fd00:0:11::2

on recent versions of Linux kernel (>=5.5) it is also possible to ping the router IP address on 
the interface with the host, while on previous ones it was not possible due to a bug in the SRv6
implementation:
h11# ping6 fd00:0:83::1

Note that this is not the suggested approach, the explicit configuration of decap instruction
is preferred, as described hereafter

we use a decap SID in r8 and in r1 with the End.DT6 behavior, the SID used is fcff:8::100

1.3) set tunnel from r1 to r8 for fd00:0:83::/64

   on r1: ip -6 route add fd00:0:83::/64 encap seg6 mode encap segs fcff:4::1,fcff:8::100 dev r1-h11

   on r8: ip -6 route add fcff:8::100 encap seg6local action End.DT6 table 254 dev r8-h83

1.4) set tunnel from r8 to r1 for fd00:0:11::/64

  on r8: ip -6 route add fd00:0:11::/64 encap seg6 mode encap segs fcff:4::1,fcff:1::100 dev r8-h83

  on r1: ip -6 route add fcff:1::100 encap seg6local action End.DT6 table 254 dev r1-h11

table 254 corresponds to the "main" routing table, using recent version of ip command
we can use table name instead of table id, for example
on r8: ip -6 route add fcff:8::100 encap seg6local action End.DT6 table main dev r8-h83



------ISIS CONFIGURATION-------------

Install guide and How to get FRR

The official FRR website is located at https://frrouting.org/ and contains further information, as well as links to additional resources.

Several distributions provide packages for FRR. Check your distribution’s repositories to find out if a suitable version is available.

Daemons Configuration File

After a fresh install, starting FRR will do nothing. This is because daemons must be explicitly enabled by editing a file in your configuration directory. This file is usually located at /etc/frr/ daemons and determines which daemons are activated when issuing a service start / stop command via init or systemd. The file initially looks like this:

zebra=no
bgpd=no
ospfd=no
ospf6d=no
ripd=no
ripngd=no
isisd=yes
pimd=no
ldpd=no
nhrpd=no
eigrpd=no
babeld=no
sharpd=no
staticd=no
pbrd=no
bfdd=no
fabricd=no

....

We have to enable the deamon, so modify the word "isis=no" with "isisd=yes"


----ISIS Configuration----

Common options can be specified (Common Invocation Options) to isisd. isisd needs to acquire interface information from zebra in order to function. Therefore zebra must be running before invoking isisd. Also, if zebra is restarted then isisd must be too.


Each routers contains the files "isisd.conf" "start.sh" "zebra.conf"


The configuration of "zebra.conf" of each routers is for example:
!
hostname r1
log file nodeconf/r1/zebra.log
!
debug zebra events
debug zebra rib
!
interface r1-h11
 ipv6 address fd00:0:11::1/64
!
interface r1-h12
 ipv6 address fd00:0:12::1/64
!
interface r1-h13
 ipv6 address fd00:0:13::1/64
!
interface r1-r2
 ipv6 address fcf0:0:1:2::1/64
!
interface lo
 ipv6 address fcff:1::1/128
!
ipv6 forwarding
!
line vty
!


In this file we define the interface between the links of router r1 and the hosts that are linked, in particular we also define the interface "lo" of the router 
With the command "ipv6 forwarding" we explicitly enable the ipv6 forwarding



The configuration of "isisd.conf" of each routers is for example:

hostname rx
password XXXX
log file nodeconf/r1/isisd.log
!
interface lo
 ipv6 router isis XX
 ip router isis XX
 isis hello-interval 5
!
interface r1-h1 
 ipv6 router isis XX
 ip router isis XX
 isis hello-interval 5
!
interface r1-r2 
 ipv6 router isis XX
 ip router isis XX
 isis hello-interval 5
!
interface r1-r3
 ipv6 router isis XX
 ip router isis XX
 isis hello-interval 5
!
router isis XX
  net 49.000X.XXXX.XXXX.XXXX.00
  is-type level-2-only
  metric-style wide
!
line vty

we use the command "ipv6 router isis XX" to use ipv6
the command "isis hello-interval (1-600)
" configure the level 1 hello interval

The command
net XX.XXXX. ... .XXX.XX
Set/Unset network entity title (NET) provided in ISO format.
NETs take several forms, depending on your network requirements. NET addresses are hexadecimal and range from 8 octets to 20 octets in length. Generally, the format consists of an authority and format Identifier (AFI), a domain ID, an area ID, a system identifier, and a selector. The simplest format omits the domain ID and is 10 octets long. For example, the NET address 49.0001.1921.6800.1001.00 consists of the following parts:

49—AFI
0001—Area ID
1921.6800.1001—System identifier
00—Selector

The system identifier must be unique within the network.
The first portion of the address is the area number, which is a variable number from 1 through 13 bytes. The first byte of the area number (49) is the authority and format indicator (AFI). The next bytes are the assigned domain (area) identifier, which can be from 0 through 12 bytes. In the examples above, the area identifier is 0001.
The next six bytes form the system identifier. The system identifier can be any six bytes that are unique throughout the entire domain. The system identifier commonly is the media access control (MAC) address.
The last byte (00) is the n-selector.



The command
  is-type level-2-only

Level 1 systems route within an area; when the destination is outside an area, they route toward a Level 2 system. Level 2 intermediate systems route between areas and toward other ASs. No IS-IS area functions strictly as a backbone.
Level 1 routers share intra-area routing information, and Level 2 routers share interarea information about IP addresses available within each area. Uniquely, IS-IS routers can act as both Level 1 and Level 2 routers, sharing intra-area routes with other Level 1 routers and interarea routes with other Level 2 routers.

We can choose level 1 or level 2, but its a good idea use level 2 beacause we can route packet out of the networks

----Configuration of Hosts----

each host has a configuration file called start.sh
Currently IPv6 forwarding is not explicitly enabled in start.sh, we have to configure ipv6 addresses for each hosts

Example of configuration of start.sh

NODE_NAME=h11
GW_NAME=r1
IF_NAME=$NODE_NAME-$GW_NAME
IP_ADDR=fd00:0:11::2/64
GW_ADDR=fd00:0:11::1

ip -6 addr add $IP_ADDR dev $IF_NAME 
ip -6 route add default via $GW_ADDR dev $IF_NAME

----Configuration of the Controller----

The controller has a configuration file called start.sh in which we set the IP address. Since the controller is connected to the other nodes through a switch, the gateway is not required.

NODE_NAME=controller
SW_NAME=sw
IF_NAME=$NODE_NAME-$SW_NAME
IP_ADDR=fcfd:0:0:fd::1/48

ip -6 addr add $IP_ADDR dev $IF_NAME

----Addressing----

the addressing on the links between the hosts hxy and the router x can be
Router interface rx-hxy fd00:0:xy::1/64
Host interface hxy-ry fd00:0:xy::2/64

```
